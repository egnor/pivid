# pivid TODO

* Network interface!
* More unit testing!
* File access sandboxing
* Better control about what gets buffered
* Better forward-seek vs play-forward decision making in frame_loader
* Manage forward-edge decoder retention based on trend of bezier
* Write pivid_scan_media as a high level alternative to pivid_inspect_avformat
* Investigate issues with alpha channel decoding in DXV (works but buggy)
* Investigate alpha channel decoding for HEVC (completely missing)
